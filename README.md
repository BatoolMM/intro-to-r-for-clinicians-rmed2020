# R/Medicine 2020 - Intro to R for Clinicians Workshop

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data. 
 

## Course Description

In an intensive half-day workshop, we will cover how to import data from files, how to explore the data and visualize it, and how to put together an attractively formatted report that summarizes the approach and findings, along with all the analytic programming code. Importantly, this report will be reproducible: anyone who has access to the raw data will be able to exactly reproduce all analyses and graphs in the report.

We will practice coding skills in class. Lecture material will be broken up by several interactive coding exercises to reinforce material just covered. 

This is **not** a programming course, and you will **not** be skilled at computer programming after completing it. But you will gain confidence in your ability to use R/RStudio to create a reproducible report in which you import, explore, and visualize clinical data. 


## Pre-course work/requirements

- Preferably two screens (or two laptops), one for the Zoom conference software, and one in which you will work. (an iPad can serve as the Zoom platform but is not ideal). 
- We will be utilizing Zoom for this workshop, please download and install the latest version [here](https://zoom.us/download).
- The program that we will be using to interact with R during the course is called **RStudio**. We will be using a cloud based version of RStudio in our workshop. You will receive user credentials before the workshop.
- While not required, we **highly** recommend installing RStudio Desktop on your laptop as well. See instructions below. While we won't be using it during the workshop, you'll need it for future R work.
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [Intro to R for Clinicians Pre-Course Survey]().


### Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, _in the long term_, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private or PHI containing data. You can find a video with step by step instructions for installing on Mac or PC by following the links below:

- [macOS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g) 
- [Windows Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)

Please complete each step in the video in turn including the final step, installing the `tidyverse` packages.


## A note on the mechanics and etiquette of the virtual workshop

* Please refrain from screen grabbing other user's information, recording the workshop, or otherwise disrupting the flow of the Zoom Meeting.
* Microphones will be muted during workshop main sessions but during breakout exercises you will be asked to collaboratively interact with your colleagues and an instructor. We encourage you to activate your video for the workshop. 
 
## Prior to the worshop

We will be holding an A/V and technical check for participants to make sure they are prepared for the workshop. 


## The day of the workshop

The workshop is scheduled to begin at 11 AM EDT. In order to make sure that we can begin on schedule please make every effort to log into the Zoom conference 10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled, ensure your computer audio and video is set up, and log into your RStudio instance.


## About the instructors

Stephan Kadauke, MD, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia where he is the Assistant Director of the Cell and Gene Therapy Lab. He leads the Cell and Gene Therapy DataOps group which builds and deploys predictive models and other data products for the care of children who receive bone marrow transplants and other cell therapies. 

Amrom Obstfeld MD, PhD, is the Medical Director of the Division of Pathology Informatics directs the Hematology and Coagulation Laboratories at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In this role Amrom leads the development of analytic tools to aid in laboratory quality management, administration, and operation, supports the deployment of new IS infrastructure in pathology and interfaces with other groups throughout the hospital on informatics initiatives. Dr. Obstfeld plays a major role in designing and implementing educational experiences for pathology trainees and faculty at the University of Pennsylvania within the areas of clinical and pathology informatics. 

Joseph Rudolf, MD is the medical director for the automated core laboratory at ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City, Utah. He earned his medical degree (2012) from the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, Washington. He completed his residency training in Clinical Pathology (2015) and fellowship in Clinical Informatics (2017) at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. His clinical and research interests focus on the intersection of informatics and clinical operations including clinical decision support, utilization management, and reporting and analytics. He is also passionate about clinical process improvement and initiatives to support quality and safety.
